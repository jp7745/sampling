The benchmark performer shall place "solution" files in this directory.  The solution file is in HDF5 format.  We chose the HDF5 file format instead of JSON because solution files may be large.

The benchmark performer may use any computational method for any instance.  We give an *example* script that uses Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling to generate solution files in `../scripts/benchmark_performer_mcmc.py`.
